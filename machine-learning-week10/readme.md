# [Week 10 - Large Scale Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/10)


### Gradient Descent with Large Datasets

* Learning with Larget Datasets

* Stochastic Gradient Descent (shuffle the data set, calculate the theta once every time)

* mini-batch Gradient Descent (Use b example in each iteration, b = mini-batch size, usually in range 2 ~ 100)


### Advanced Topics
a brief overview of following topic.

* Online Training

* Map-reduce and data parallelism
