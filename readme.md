# [Machine Learning Course (Coursera) by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

This is a beginner Course for Macine Learning, I save my course assignment solution and course Notes here for further reference.

# **Course Self-Note**

## Week One

As I getting start to learn Machine Learning with Andrew Ng's ML class, I would love to write what I have got from the class.

First week is an introduction, 
- what is machine learning by definition, the source of where machine learning comes from, some real-world examples. 
- main categories of machine learning - supervisor ML, unsupervised ML and Reinforce ML.
- illustrate what is Machine Learning Modeling, cost function, parameters by use example of linear regression (the simplest one) 
- explain what is gradient descent

In my own word -

> This week's content is to explain what is Machine learning.
> And with my understanding, machine learning is to use given data sets or environment variables with computer to figure out some meaningful info inside the data for general human being to understand. 
>For example, giving historical data on housing price,  use machine learning to predict other unsold house's market price.



## Week Two

Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables

Gradient Descent in Practice I - Feature Scaling

Gradient Descent in Practice II - Learning Rate - alpha

Features and Polynomial Regression 

Normal Equation - (another way to get the answers, the better way)


|Gradient Descent	| Normal Equation |
|-------------------|-----------------|
|Need to choose alpha | No need to choose alpha |
|Needs many iterations | No need to iterate |
|Works well when n is large | Slow if n is very large |
